My name is Kai, and I am a passionate security researcher with a love for computers that dates back to my childhood when I got my first laptop. Since then, I’ve been building my knowledge and honing my skills in cybersecurity, focusing on both blue and red team exercises.

I’ve spent countless hours on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox, sharpening my expertise and learning about various attack and defence techniques. My goal is to land a Security Analyst role, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to help organizations protect their digital assets.

In terms of experience, I am proficient in Python, Go, and JavaScript, and have been delving into reverse engineering, red teaming, and blue teaming. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of my understanding in the world of cybersecurity.

When I’m not immersed in security research, I enjoy building and expanding my home lab. This personal playground allows me to test out different red and blue team tools in an organization-like environment, helping me stay up-to-date with the latest cybersecurity practices and trends.

Outside of my professional interests, I’m an avid fan of the series Rick and Morty, The Orvil and Family Guy, as you can tell i am a big fan of Seth MacFarlane. But don't worry i do spend time outside by going on my sunset/sunrise Jogs, got to touch grass once in a while.

Feel free to explore my website, where I showcase my skills, share my knowledge, and document my journey in the exciting world of cybersecurity. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, don’t hesitate to contact me.
