If you need to reach out to me, feel free to email me at: byteshell\[at\]starksinfosec.com.

You can also use the alternate email: starksinfosec\[at\]protonmail\[dot\]com.

You can also connect with me on social media:

X: @ByteShell101  
Mastodon: @<nightsec101@infosec.exchange>

Additional platforms are available upon request.

If you’re unsure about the legitimacy of the email, you can verify it by contacting me on Twitter at @byteshell101 or on Mastodon at @<nightsec101@infosec.exchange>.

Please understand that while I am committed to alerting entities about potential security issues, it is not my responsibility to ensure that you acknowledge the problem. If my attempts to reach out are ignored, I may resort to public tweets about the company’s lack of response to notifications.

To avoid potential PR or regulatory issues, ensure that you have clear channels for people to report data security concerns and train your staff to escalate these notifications appropriately. If they suspect that the notifications might be fake or a potential scam, they should avoid clicking on any links but should still involve a supervisor or someone who can verify the notice.

I hope I never have to contact you about a security issue, but if I do, I urge you to take the notification seriously.
