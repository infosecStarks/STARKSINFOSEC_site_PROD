My name is Kai, and I’m a Security Researcher passionate about Security.

I’ll share my research and insights on various security-related topics in this blog. I’ll cover everything from Threat Research, Vulnerability Research, Red and Blue Teaming, and some of the latest news on security.

My goal with this blog is to provide valuable information and resources to anyone interested in security, whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned pro. I’ll conduct research, share my experiences, and provide recommendations based on my findings.

So, if you’re ready to dive into the exciting world of infosec, then let’s get started!
